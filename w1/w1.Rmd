# Sample Code

```{r setup, include=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Test

```{r data}
setwd('~/Documents/DSP/Data_Science_Programming/w1')
data <- read.table( './data.csv', header=TRUE, sep=',' )
data[,'name']
data[1,]
data[,1:2]
data[,'id']
class(data[,'name'])
```
